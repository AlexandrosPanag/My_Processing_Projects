Receiving Data From Arduino
-----

Process, gives us the abillity to "translate" arduino written code that was written on the serial. I highly recommend running the program https://github.com/AlexandrosPanag/My_Arduino_Projects/tree/main/Serial_Random_Number_Generator on your arduino ide, then using the code that i've provided on this topic (the Receiving Data From Arduino code) into your Process IDE
